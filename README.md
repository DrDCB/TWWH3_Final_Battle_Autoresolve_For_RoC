# Final Battle Autoresolve (for Realms of Chaos Campaign)
A mod for Total War Warhammer III. A simple mod that enables autoresolve for the final battle against Be'lakor in the Forge of Souls (just like the four Daemon Prince soul survival battles in the Chaos realms). Useful if you are using other mods to minimise the hassle of the Realm of Chaos campaign without disabling it altogether.

N.B. You'll probably want a fairly reasonable tier 4/5 army in order to be able to win on VH/Legendary, unless you are also using a mod that changes the autoresolve difficulty scaling.

Mod originally uploaded to the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2790243463). Releases added here to support other platforms.
